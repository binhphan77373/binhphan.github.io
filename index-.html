                    In the Autonomous Drone in Maze project, I built autonomous drone system focused on real-time sensing, mapping, planning, and navigation 
  within a maze environment. My work involved creating a seamless simulation environment through the integration of Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) pipelines 
  and the implementation of real-time algorithms. This setup allowed drone flight simulation on a workstation while running SLAM, mapping, planning, 
  navigation, and control modules in real-time on the Jetson.

I optimized and allocated computing resources across the embedded CPU-DLA-GPU, which enhanced the performance of SLAM, 
mapping, planning, navigation, and object detection. These efforts enabled the drone to achieve efficient flight speeds 
and navigate through dense obstacle environments, showcasing the system's capability to operate effectively in challenging conditions on the Jetson.

                    In the Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) Communication for Driving Assistance project, I led the development of real-time, 
  resource-efficient computer vision algorithms to facilitate urban traffic management through embedded systems, optimizing for both 
  cost and power consumption. Leveraging object detection and tracking techniques, I spearheaded the analysis of traffic flows across 
  19 camera feeds, significantly contributing to smarter city infrastructure.

My role also encompassed the design and refinement of a lightweight AI model capable of vehicle tracking and crowd counting. 
This innovation empowered four Odroid N2+ edge devices to simultaneously process live feeds from nine cameras and establish 
seamless communication with Autonomous Vehicles. Furthermore, I guided and mentored a team of 15 student assistants in the nuances 
of AI data handling, including meticulous preparation and annotation.

            This project is dedicated to accurately counting individuals waiting at bus stops, aiming to estimate 
  bus demand and enhance the efficiency of the bus schedule system. Achieving this goal involves the development 
  of a lightweight computer vision system and an optimized deep learning model. These innovations enable real-time 
  and resilient performance on resource-constrained embedded computing platforms. Notably, the project achieves significant 
  reductions in power consumption, facilitating continuous operation 24/7. This capability ensures precise people counting 
  even amidst fluctuations in illumination and varying degrees of crowded scenarios in Singapore.

The primary goal of this project is to estimate traffic density across different lanes on the road. 
To achieve this, the project has developed a lightweight computer vision algorithm specifically 
designed to detect the percentage of lane occupancy. This algorithm operates seamlessly on resource-constrained 
embedded computing platforms, ensuring continuous functionality 24/7. It is adept at handling changes in illumination 
and various weather conditions, providing reliable traffic density estimates on roads in Singapore.
